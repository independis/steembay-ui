<h2>What is steembay?</h2>
<p>
    steembay is a blockchain based auction system to sell/buy goods and services for cryptocurrency (STEEM/SBD).
</p>

<h2>Why another auction platform?</h2>
<p>
There are almost no ways to transfer cryptocurrencies directly into goods and services. The point of steembay is to create a marketplace where people can earn and use their cryptos in a way that is more than mere investment and speculation.
An auction platform is a great market to figure out the real value given by the people to a currency, a service or an item.
</p>

<h2>Why the STEEM blockchain?</h2>
<p>
The STEEM Blockchain provides a censorship resistant, fast and reliable basis for auctioning. There is no way to cheat the bidding process.<br>
</p><p>
The STEEM Blockchain provides an integrated and very fast transferable currency (SBD / STEEM), which is available all over the world (3 Second transfers without any fees or limitations).<br>
</p><p>
The STEEM Blockchain already provides a home for an amazing and growing community of content creators, artists, writers and bloggers. More than a million created accounts speak their own language.<br>
</p>

<h2>How to start?</h2>
